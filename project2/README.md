Project Objective: This project is a simple console-based menu system 
for a coffee shop called Roast Bean Cafe. The program displays a menu 
of drinks (hot and cold) and desserts, allows the user to place an 
order, calculates the total cost, and processes payment. The project 
utilizes C++ features such as smart pointers, dynamic memory 
allocation, classes, structs, and enumerations.

- Smart Pointers: Utilizes std::unique_ptr for dynamic memory management.

- Order Processing: Allows the customer to select menu items and enter quantities for each selection.

- Price Calculation: Computes the total price based on the user's selections.

- Payment System: Accepts the payment amount from the user and calculates any change to be returned.

- Closing Message: Thanks the customer for their visit once the transaction is completed.
